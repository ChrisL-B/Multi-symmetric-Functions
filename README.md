# Multi-symmetric-Functions
Code accompanying the paper "Quarter-BPS states, multi-symmetric functions and set partitions", found on arxiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01734. The code constructs exactly quarter-BPS operators at weak coupling in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. It is a Jupyter notebook designed to be run with a SageMath 8.9 kernel. It is simplest to run this using the SageMath notebook. The latest version of SageMath can be found at https://www.sagemath.org/.
